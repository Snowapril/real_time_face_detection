Real Time face features detection through webcam
============

you can predict one picture by typing below command on cmd


"`
python predict.py imagename.png

like this. you need to put image in the same folder before do it.

until yet, this project is incompleted because it's accuracy is little bit low.

please wait for me to fix my first beginner project.
